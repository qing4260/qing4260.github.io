My most ambitious goal is to be a good UX designer, and all my other small goals are built around becoming UX designers. When I first met UX design, I found its charm. Our efforts are not only to get a job but more importantly, this work can bring happiness to people. Improve product availability, ease of use and user enjoyment. This makes the job and discipline more meaningful. What I was most impressed with within my experience with UX was that a school building was designed by UX students. I am very admired for the intimate detail design and excellent user experience. I think this is my future goal, becoming a UX designer dedicated to improving the lives of others.
